### Barkley is a webapp built with React.js, for use with the [BRKLY](https://github.com/Team-Fourtress/brkly) backend API built with Django.

The [Barkley](https://barkley.netlify.app/) repository provides the frontend of our Barkley app. Barkley allows users to create dog and owner profiles, connect with other users via direct message and discussion boards, schedule meetups based on location, and share posts to a newsfeed.

This was the final project for [Momentum Learning](https://www.momentumlearn.com/), created by [Taylor Leach](https://github.com/tleach01) & [Jameel Salhhadin](https://github.com/loxducthegreat), with additions from [Kyle McConaughey](https://github.com/kylemcconaughey) & [Clint Jordan](https://github.com/clintjordan5).
